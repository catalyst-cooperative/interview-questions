# Interview Questions
This repository contains some Jupyter Notebooks outlining take home problems for
discussion in our technical interview process.

The notebooks make use of data published as part of our [Public Utility Data
Liberation](https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl) (PUDL) project. To make
accessing the data and associated software easier, we have packaged them up
with a Docker image, and [archived them on
Zenodo](https://sandbox.zenodo.org/record/764696). That archive also includes a README
file explaining how to run the Docker image, and some more general PUDL example
notebooks using `docker-compose`.

Once you have that Docker container up and running the Jupyter Notebook server, download
the notebooks from this repository and put them in the `notebooks` folder associated
with the Docker container. You should see them show up in the available files within
the Jupyter Lab interface, and you can follow the instructions in the notebook.
