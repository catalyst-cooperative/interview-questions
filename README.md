# Interview Questions
This repository contains some Jupyter Notebooks outlining take home problems for
discussion in our technical interview process. To run the notebooks:
* make sure that `conda` is installed and no `conda` environment is activated.
* clone this repository, and from within the top level repo directory run:

```bash
conda env create
conda activate catalyst-takehome
jupyter lab
```

* If you're interested in the [Data Wrangler](https://catalyst.coop/work-with-us/data-wrangler/)
  role, then work with the `data-wrangler.ipynb` notebook.

Each notebook contains more specific instructions. We're asking you to spend 2 hours
on the take-home problem.
