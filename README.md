# Interview Questions
This repository contains some Jupyter Notebooks outlining take home problems for discussion in our technical interview process.

To work with these notebooks you'll want to download an archive of the PUDL data, and run the associated Docker container. You can find instructions on how to do that in the [PUDL Examples repository](https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl-examples).

Once you have that environment set up, download the notebooks from this repo and add them to the `notebooks` folder you cloned from the PUDL examples repo.
