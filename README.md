# Interview Questions
This repository contains some Jupyter Notebooks outlining take home problems for
discussion in our technical interview process.

* If you're interested in the [Data Wrangler & Analyst](https://catalyst.coop/data-wrangler-analyst/)
  role, then work with the `data-wranglyer-analyst.ipynb` notebook.
* If you're interested in the [Software & Data Engineer](https://catalyst.coop/software-data-engineer/)
  role, then work with the `software-data-engineer.ipynb` notebook.

Each notebook contains more specific instructions. We're asking you to spend ~4 hours on
the take-home problem, and to send us your work no more than 1 week after we invite you
to work on them.
