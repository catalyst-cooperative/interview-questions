# Interview Questions
This repository contains some Jupyter Notebooks outlining take home problems for
discussion in our technical interview process. To run the notebooks:
* make sure that `conda` is installed and no `conda` environment is activated.
* clone this repository, and from within the top level repo directory run:

```bash
conda env create
conda activate catalyst-takehome
jupyter lab
```

* If you're interested in the [Data Wrangler & Analyst](https://catalyst.coop/data-wrangler-analyst/)
  role, then work with the `data-wranglyer-analyst.ipynb` notebook.
* If you're interested in the [Software & Data Engineer](https://catalyst.coop/software-data-engineer/)
  role, then work with the `software-data-engineer.ipynb` notebook.

Each notebook contains more specific instructions. We're asking you to spend 2-4 hours
on the take-home problem, and to send us your work after no more than 1 week has
elapsed.
