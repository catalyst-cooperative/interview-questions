# Interview Questions
This repository contains some Jupyter Notebooks outlining take home problems for
discussion in our technical interview process.

The notebooks make use of data published as part of our [Public Utility Data
Liberation](https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl) (PUDL) project. To make
accessing the data and associated software easier, we have packaged them up
with a Docker image, and [archived them on
Zenodo](https://sandbox.zenodo.org/record/764696). That archive also includes a README
file explaining how to run the Docker image, and some more general PUDL example
notebooks using `docker-compose`.

Once you have that Docker container up and running the Jupyter Notebook server, download
the notebooks from this repository and put them in the `notebooks` folder associated
with the Docker container. You should see them show up in the available files within
the Jupyter Lab interface, and you can follow the instructions in the relevant notebook.

* If you're interested in the [Data Wrangler & Analyst](https://catalyst.coop/data-wrangler-analyst/)
  role, then work with the `data-wranglyer-analyst` notebook.
* If you're interested in the [Software & Data Engineer](https://catalyst.coop/software-data-engineer/)
  role... hold on! We're still developing the technical interview process.
